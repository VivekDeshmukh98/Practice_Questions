Certainly, here are some important coding questions on arrays and strings that are frequently asked in interviews:

1. **Two Sum:**
   Given an array of integers and a target sum, find two numbers that add up to the target sum.

2. **Reverse String:**
   Reverse a given string without using any extra space.

3. **Valid Palindrome:**
   Determine if a given string is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

4. **Rotate Array:**
   Rotate an array to the right by a given number of steps.

5. **Maximum Subarray Sum:**
   Find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum in an array.

6. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array:**
   Remove duplicates from a sorted array and return the new length.

7. **Move Zeroes:**
   Move all zeroes to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of other elements.

8. **Longest Common Prefix:**
   Find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

9. **Valid Anagram:**
   Check if two given strings are anagrams of each other.

10. **Container With Most Water:**
    Given an array of non-negative integers representing the heights of bars, find the maximum area of water that can be trapped between two bars.

11. **String to Integer (atoi):**
    Implement the `atoi` function that converts a string to an integer.

12. **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:**
    Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

13. **Group Anagrams:**
    Group anagrams together from a list of strings.

14. **Product of Array Except Self:**
    Given an array `nums`, return an array `output` such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

15. **Minimum Size Subarray Sum:**
    Given an array of positive integers and a target sum, find the minimum length of a contiguous subarray whose sum is at least the target sum.

16. **Valid Parentheses:**
    Determine if a given string containing only parentheses, brackets, and curly braces is valid.

17. **3Sum:**
    Find all unique triplets in the array that sum up to the target value.

18. **String Compression:**
    Compress a string by replacing repeated characters with the character followed by the count.

19. **Subarray with Zero Sum:**
    Given an array of integers, find if there's a subarray with a sum equal to zero.

20. **First Missing Positive:**
    Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing positive integer.

These coding questions cover various aspects of arrays and strings, ranging from manipulation to searching and problem-solving. Practicing these questions will help you build a strong foundation in problem-solving and prepare you for coding interviews.
